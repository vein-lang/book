## Overview

The Vein Runtime module APIs define the base of the Vein language. 
These APIs include:

- Types such as the [Object](./api/Object) class and the [ValueType](./api/ValueType) protocol that provide the root functionality of most Vein classes.
- Functions and data structures that comprise the Vein runtime, which provides support for the dynamic properties of the Vein language.

You typically don't need to use this module directly.


The Vein runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Vein language, and as such is linked to by all Vein apps.
